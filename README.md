# Food Funk

Minecraft mod: What is that funky smell in my backpack? Food spoils over time unless preserved. Configure any item to rot, any container to preserve items.

* Food [rots](Food-Spoiling-(Rot)) over time.  Make any item [rot](Food-Spoiling-(Rot)) into any other item (or none at all) over a specified time (via [configuration](Configuration)).
* Preserving containers (the [Esky](Esky) and [Freezer](Freezer)) slow or stop rot a specified amount.  Add more via [configuration](Configuration).
* Default [configuration](Configuration) entries support vanilla Minecraft and [other food mods](Compatibility). 
* Any item from any mod can be [specified](Configuration), and specifiers include support for metadata and ore dictionary names.
