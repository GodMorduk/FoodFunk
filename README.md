# FoodFunk

Minecraft mod: What is that funky smell in my backpack?   Food spoils over time.  Any item can be configured to rot.

Idea based on the food rot feature from the discontinued [EnviroMine](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/enviromine) mod - thanks to the authors!  If you want food rot for 1.7.10 or earlier, consider EnviroMine.
